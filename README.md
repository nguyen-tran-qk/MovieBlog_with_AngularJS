This web is a simple small team work of me and my friend.

We make this after completing the Angular course on "angular.codeschool.com" by applying the skills in the tutorials.

My friend started it with a movie blog idea and build the markup. You can see his work [here](https://github.com/minhkhoi28/smallProject/tree/master/MovieBlog)

I took care of the Angular tricks and navigation pane.
